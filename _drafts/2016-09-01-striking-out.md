[from The Free Dictionary](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/striking+out)

I am setting out on a course of action involving something new. But I will also strike out in the sense of failing. At least that's the hope.

I've never built a software framework before. I don't know how to do it. I certainly don't know how to do it well. Which means I'll do it poorly.  At least at first.

There are three kinds of failure:

1. Deviation: (knew better; poor judgement)
2. Complexity in Uncontrollable Situations (unavoidable, uncontrollable, manageable)
3. Thoughtful experimentation (learning to walk)

Having a useful framework at the end will be a desirable artifact of the learning process. Perhaps more valuable to me will be the understanding gained through doing so.

In order to learn, I'll have to have the 3rd kind of failure. A lot.
