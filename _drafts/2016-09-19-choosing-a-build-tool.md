# Choosing a Build Tool

A while back I attempted to get webpack running via a grunt task in a Sails.js project. I failed. In looking at the docs I didn't persevere, gave up, and switched to using Browserify, which I was able to get running (and so didn't give up on it as well).

But now I'm back and going to try webpack again, this time on its own using webpack-dev-server by itself.  I'll be doing this as part of my next steps with learning Redux. I'd watched the [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) videos (which are easily among the best coding tutorials I've seen), and typed them all in by hand and got them working. It was a very educational experience.

But now I need to actually use Redux in a bigger project. Namely, a game I'd eventually like to run using React Native and Redux on iOS.  But first I need to develop the skill of knowing what works and what doesn't when designing the store shape for a larger-than-hello-world app.

I'm going to start with Tic-Tac-Toe and progressively build up to larger and more complex apps. I could definitely just go look at the more full featured examples available on the interwebs.  In fact, I will.  But primarily I'll be going along, trial and error style, so that I can internalize the design skill, not just augment my copy/paste/hack-til-it-kinda-works skill.  That monster's already very well fed.

As a side note, I'm going to try webpack again mostly because Dan mentioned it, and also because I've heard it mentioned at least as much as Browserify if not more.  When in Rome and all that.
