# Setting up Webpack

Here's what I did starting out.

Create a directory (I called mine `redux-learn`).  `cd` into the new directory and run

    npm init

Hit enter to accept the defaults and save the file.  You can always change it later.  This will create a `package.json` file for you.  It's important to have this in place before installing everything so that the `--save-dev` will add things to it for you.  Otherwise you'll have to search the web for how to manually populate it, or reinstall everything with npm after creating the file (which is what I did).
